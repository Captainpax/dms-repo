# Repository Guidelines

This repository contains the custom Docker configurations for DarkMatterServers.com. Keep documentation and Docker-specific assets within the relevant subdirectories.

- Place Docker definitions and related resources under the `dockers/` directory.
- Use clear naming for Dockerfiles to reflect their service or role.
- Document any deployment scripts, environment variables, or workflow changes in README files that live alongside the affected resources.
- Update README files whenever you add or modify functionality so future contributors can trace what changed and why.
- Include a short summary of your work in commit messages to aid auditing.
